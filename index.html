      &emsp;&emsp;This week’s content in Defense Against the Dark Arts covered malware forensics and the methods and tools involved with it. Two in-class labs were focused on this week as well that aimed to provide experience with the forensic tools FTK Imager and Volatility.<br><br>

      &emsp;&emsp;The basis of malware forensics is to identify, preserve, and analyze evidence, and then present the results and findings to a law official for further judgment. An important aspect of being involved in malware forensics is to stay professional, unbiased, and respect your role as just a reporter of evidence, leaving the interpretation and ultimate decision on how to move forward to the court of law. Some of the important evidence acquisitions are memory, drive or long-term storage, and any network traffic.<br><br>

      &emsp;&emsp;Because evidence is everything in forensics, there are specific precautions and procedures to follow when executing an investigation, many of which have already been predefined. One of these procedures revolves around the order of volatility within a computer system, and describes the order in which evidence should be collected from a system in order to ensure the most results. The order begins with system memory and temporary file systems such as as the swap file or paging file, and ends with any physical configurations or backups. It is also extremely important to reduce any contamination of potential evidence in the process gathering it.<br><br>

      &emsp;&emsp;The first in-class lab of focus this week was a lab on the FTK Imager tool. This tool allows you to create forensic images of a drive or other source of storage, and export them to any destination, such as an external drive plugged into the target. This tool allows you to copy data off of the storage such as the master file table, page table file, hibernation file, and any other content on the drive. It can also export the data to different formats, included just raw. In the lab, we tested the tool by just creating an image of our virtual machine in order to play around with the different features and capabilities.<br><br>

      &emsp;&emsp;The second lab we did in-class demonstrated the Volatility tool. This is a command line tool that is used to perform analysis on memory dumps and can provide a lot of information on what was stored in memory, such as information on the operating system, networking artifacts, process permissions, and what processes currently loaded in memory. A command that was covered in class was “dlllist”, which lists all of the currently loaded processes and their id’s, but also the processes’ loaded dll’s to see which are related.<br><br>

      &emsp;&emsp;To begin defending against dark arts, we must first be able to identify them. This week’s content of CS 373 included some of the basics of malware, such as being able to identify different types of malware, analyzing their behavior in order to prevent future attacks, and who these attackers even are.<br /><br />

      &emsp;&emsp;In the world of malware and malware defense, there are many descriptive terms that are used in order to communicate with each other professionally. Two very commonly used terms are white and black, which are used to describe if a piece of software is clean or dirty, respectively. This allows communities involved to be aware if certain software can be trusted. When the integrity of a sample is unknown, it is referred to as grey. Another basic for malware is the naming convention. The convention is as follows: type(:), platform(/), family, (.)variant, and (!)information. An example of this looks like: “Trojan:Win32/Reveton.N”.<br /><br />

      &emsp;&emsp;A term that was new to me that ended up receiving some discussion in the lecture was a “polymorphic” piece of malware. This is a type of malware that will constantly change key elements of itself to avoid detection and make stopping it much harder. What was most interesting about polymorphic malware though, was its rarity. The lecturer, Christiaan Beek with Intel Security/McAfee Labs, stated that these pieces of malware were extremely hard to detect and diagnose, yet they were not extremely difficult to create. I believe that the reasoning for this was that they are not worth the extra effort/skill for a hacker to create when there are much simpler alternatives that can be just as successful. What’s particularly unsettling about this is that these threats are still not having to use the most powerful tricks, and can still be a massive problem.<br /><br />

      &emsp;&emsp;Just like attackers have tools for creating malware, we also have tools for analyzing them. Each tool has a purpose, and they can do things such as monitor process events and network activity, close off connections, or even create fake connections in order to capture any outgoing requests. Some names of tools for analyzing malware include: Process Monitor, FakeNet, FileInsight, and Wireshark. The malware needs to be running in order to be able to analyze it though, so it is important to create simulated environments to run the malware in order to keep it contained and analyze safely. These are sometimes called “goats”, a sacrificial environment to let the malware do what it does.<br /><br />

      &emsp;&emsp;So who really are these attackers? And what do they want? We classify malware attackers as APTs, or Advanced Persistent Threats, and they mostly consist of governments, organized crime groups, and competitors within a marketplace. One of their biggest motivators, unsurprisingly, is often money, but it can also be for ideology, revenge, or just for the fun. A typical pattern is also followed by these attackers. This pattern includes reconnaissance, weaponization, delivery, exploitation, installation, command and control, and finally, action.<br /><br />

      &emsp;&emsp;What really drove home for me why malware defense and forensics and be so exciting, is the concept of baiting. Just like fishing, the excitement comes from knowing the targets and strategically setting up environments to get the best of them. Two forms of baiting were mentioned: honeypot baiting and baiting for malware replication. Honeypots are machines that are placed around the world waiting to receive a malware attack in order for it to be analyzed, and baiting for malware replication involves intentionally staging an environment that a piece of malware is being tested in to force certain behaviors (if those behaviors exist).<br /><br />
